E-Commerce warranty system that is made using NFT

All the code is written in solidity and we had deployed this in polygon-mumbai test-net.

Instructions for Running:
1. If you want to run this on test-net, then you have to flatten this file first using remix plugin on online IDE.(https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js)
2. Add the solidity file to the default remix workspace(link is given above) and compile it.
3. You can deploy it in either VM given by remix or any test network.
5. After that by connecting your metamask with polygon test-net, you will be able to do all transactions.
